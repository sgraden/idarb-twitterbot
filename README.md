# idarb-twitterbot

Simply tweet your game ID to @idarbhash and it will periodically tweet random IDARB hashbombs to @idarbwire. Will last approximately the length of one game before clearing the game ID.

**update:** Ensure IDARB settings allow for external tweets to game. Also, Twitter is spotting this as an automated process and is blocking it unfortunately. Until a solution is found, I will not be having this run live. - 2/13/16

Build:
